# Hi, I'm Collin Finetti
**Continuous Improvement Engineer | CSE Graduate  May, 2024 - University of Toledo** 

## Professional Summary
I am a hybrid engineer that is able to bridge **Software Engineering** and **Industrial Automation** to drive cost savings and system efficiencies to the max. With my degree in CSE and my hands on plant level experience in high volume **Tier-1 Automotive Suppliers** I specialize in rapid response and data collection for tight customer demands and quality requirements. 






## Featured Automation Initiatives

### [Compressed Air Cost Recovery & Acoustic Imaging](projects/compressed-air.md)
* **The Problem:** Unquantified energy loss across the manufacturing floor due to system-wide air leaks.
* **The Solution:** Researched and deployed acoustic imaging technology (FLIR Si124) to identify and log leaks in real-time.
* **The Result:** Achieved **$236,000+ in annual utility savings** with an immediate device ROI of less than one month.

### [Jeep Grand Cherokee Bodyside Weld Optimization](projects/jeep-weldprocessimprovement.md)
* **The Problem:** High operational expenditure (OPEX) caused by frequent weld-cap failure and manual line stops.
* **The Solution:** Transitioned the bodyside assembly line to high-durability alloys and recalibrated robot weld parameters for extended life.
* **The Result:** Realized a **52% reduction in annual consumable spend** ($44k+ per line) with a 6.4-month ROI.

### [Ram 1500 Box Assembly Cycle Time Optimization](projects/ram1500-processimprovement.md)
* **The Problem:** Sub-optimal robotic motion paths and idle "wait-states" resulted in slow cycle times and restricted total throughput (JPH).
* **The Solution:** Reprogrammed FANUC robotics with "Pounce" motion paths to recover idle seconds and engineered PLC shift registers to maintain continuous flow.
* **The Result:** Achieved a **10% increase in total throughput (JPH)** through performance recovery and reached a zero-downtime model changeover standard.
