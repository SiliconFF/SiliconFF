# Weld Consumable Cost Reduction & Material Optimization: Jeep Grand Cherokee Bodyside Assembly

## Executive Summary
This project addressed high operational expenditures (OPEX) in the **Jeep Grand Cherokee (WL) Bodyside Assembly** line by optimizing the lifecycle of spot-welding electrodes. By transitioning from standard Copper-Titanium caps to high-durability specialized alloys and recalibrating weld parameters, the project achieved a **52% reduction in annual consumable spend** with a projected **ROI of 6.4 months**.

## Product Application: Jeep Grand Cherokee (WL)
The project focused on the structural bodyside assembly of the WL platform, ensuring that high-volume production met strict cost-per-unit targets without compromising weld integrity.

## The Problem: High-Frequency Replacement
The Bodyside Assembly line utilizes more than 40 individual spot-welding guns. The legacy process used standard Copper-Titanium electrodes with a limited lifespan, leading to frequent manual replacements, increased downtime, and high annual purchasing costs.

| Metric | Legacy Standard (CuTi) |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Cap Lifespan** | 1,000 Welds |
| **Annual Consumable Spend** | **$84,000+** |

## The Solution: Material Science & Parametric Tuning
I led the transition to high-performance **Copper Class 20** weld caps. 

### **Implementation Strategy:**
1. **Material Optimization:** Transitioned to high-durability alloys. While the initial material cost per unit was higher, the durability increased by **240%**, significantly lowering the "cost-per-weld" metric.
2. **Weld Study & Validation:** Partnered with third-party weld engineersto perform a multi-week validation study. This ensured that nugget size and shear strength remained within OEM specifications throughout the extended lifecycle.
3. **Parameter Optimization:** Recalibrated weld current, pressure, and "squeeze time" to maintain nugget integrity over the extended 3,400-weld lifecycle.

## Quantified Impact & ROI
The project delivered immediate financial results and established a blueprint for plant-wide scalability to other lines with out dated caps.
* **Annual Savings (Bodyside Line):** **$44,700+**
* **Consumable Efficiency:** Increased weld-per-cap count from 1,000 to **3,400**.
* **Total Cost Reduction:** Reduced daily consumable spend by over **52%**.
